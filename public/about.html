<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Md Farman Sayeed, and I am a passionate and dedicated individual with a strong interest in technology, programming, and continuous learning. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering, I have developed a solid foundation in programming languages, data structures, and web development. I am actively enhancing my skills through platforms like The Odin Project and coding resources such as LeetCode and YouTube lectures to deepen my understanding of both front-end and back-end development.</p>

<p>I believe in learning by doing, which is why I enjoy building projects that challenge me to apply what Iâ€™ve learned and think critically. I am especially interested in full-stack web development and problem-solving using C++ and Python. With an eye for detail and a desire to improve, I constantly seek feedback and new opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I am an inquisitive learner who values teamwork, communication, and perseverance. I also take pride in staying organized and meeting deadlines efficiently. My long-term goal is to become a skilled software developer who creates meaningful solutions that impact lives positively. I am excited about the journey ahead and eager to contribute to real-world projects that align with my passion for technology.</p>
